## Hobbit LSTM Text Generator

This project autogenerates text after using a copy of the Hobbit to train. Each training epoch exports the text so you can see how it evolves over time. Then, 20 paragraphs are generated.

## Installation

The program was developed in Jupyter Notebook and was written in Python 3. 

## Usage

Run the code. Any required packages are imported at the beginning.
