This is a GitHub page set up for the projects I've worked on in my Data Science career.

I'm an actuary in Florida who spent the better part of a decade working for The Walt Disney Company, where my wife still works. I live with her, my 2 dogs, one jerk of a cat and oh yeah we're expecting our first kid!
